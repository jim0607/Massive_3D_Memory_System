move h_zee to h_eff
the cost function for the gradient descent algorithm is the max of (dm_x, dm_y, dm_z for each spin)
seperate the cost_funtion with the solver, make the outlook more machine learning
read the oommf manual and add comments for rk4
then we have a good working version. Finally, change the appearce of the project to make it more object orientated.
add comments for each class, each funciton.

add anisotropy field, DMI field to h_eff
implement steepest descent just like fidimag
thinking about other gradient descent like conjegate gradient descent, adaboost and so on.
Make slides for the OOD, there is a website we can refer to.
