1. move h_zee to h_eff
2. the cost function for the gradient descent algorithm is the max of (dm_x, dm_y, dm_z for each spin)
3. seperate the cost_funtion with the solver, make the outlook more machine learning
4. read the oommf manual and add comments for rk4
5. then we have a good working version. Finally, change the appearce of the project to make it more object orientated.
6. add comments for each class, each funciton.

1. add anisotropy field, DMI field to h_eff
2. implement steepest descent just like fidimag
3. thinking about other gradient descent like conjegate gradient descent, adaboost and so on.


Make slides for the OOD, there is a website we can refer to.
